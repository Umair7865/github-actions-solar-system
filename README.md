------------------------------------------------------------

Navigate to your GitHub account and explore github-actions-solar-system repository
Go to the Actions Tab and click on I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them
There is a workflow file named solar-system.yml
There is one job named - unit-testing
The Job includes multiple steps to:

Checkout repository
Setup Node.js
Install dependencies
Run unit tests
Archive test reports
Do the following
1) Create a new branch from the main and name it feature/workflow and switch to it

A workflow should be triggered. Check that it fails in the unit testing step.
2) Work on the feature/workflow branch, add the following environment variables at the workflow level:
MONGO_URI: â€˜mongodb+srv://supercluster.d83jj.mongodb.net/superData'
MONGO_USERNAME: superuser
MONGO_PASSWORD: SuperPassword
For MONGO_PASSWORD, add it as a Repository Secret and refer it in the workflow environment variables
3) Trigger the workflow and check that it runs successfully




Was the feature/workflow branch created successfully?

Is the MONGO_URI variable configured correctly?

Is the MONGO_USERNAME variable configured correctly?

Is the MONGO_PASSWORD secret being created?

Does the MONGO_PASSWORD environment variable in the workflow reference a value in secrets?
